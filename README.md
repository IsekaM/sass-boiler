# Sass Broiler
This is just a simple boilerplate for laying out SASS **(not SCSS)** files in for many small projects (at the moment). 

## What it includes
- A customizable Bootstrap-like grid system (made with flexbox) that can be used in your project(s). The only difference is then naming system for the classes. I used BEM css instead of the regular bootstrap naming system
  Eg. `col-md-12` === `col--md-12`
- Variables that holds items like: *font-size, font-family, line-height, different font weights as well as predefined breakpoints for the grid system and font-sizes for te different header sizes*
- Button classes to help that can be added onto to help create custom buttons on your page
- Predefined header classes as well as mixins that can be changed by going into the *_vars.sass* and *_mixins.sass* folder respectively
- Simple HTML resets that removes margin/padding from the page, removes decoration from links and adds `box-sizing: border-box` rule to everything on the page

**More Will Be Added Soon! âœŒ**
